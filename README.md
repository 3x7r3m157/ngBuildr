DISCLAIMER: THIS IS FOR BASH ON LINUX BASED SYSTEMS LIKE A MAC. IF YOU HAVE BASH ON A WINDOWS BASED MACHINE, I DONT KNOW HOW WINDOWS EMULATES BASH SO THIS MAY NOT WORK IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS!!!

INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1: Open up your terminal and open up your bash profile on your favorite text editor from the command line and open up your bash profile:

ATOM: sudo atom ~/.bash_profile
VSCODE: sudo code ~/.bash_profile

STEP 2: Copy contents from my bash_profile to your's

STEP 3: Enjoy a little more automation on the struggle bus! 

Things to note - this is just simple shell scripting, you can create whatever command you want to do whatever you want. For commands that take input write as functions, othewise using the alias keyword will do. Your terminal loads this file upon first starting up, if you edit this or make new commands, you need to first restart your terminal for the new commands to take effect.
